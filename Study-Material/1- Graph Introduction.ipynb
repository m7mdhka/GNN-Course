    "        <b>Do you ever wonder how LinkedIn suggests new connections for you?</b> It feels almost magical, right? Well, there's some clever technology behind it called a Graph Neural Network (GNN). Imagine your LinkedIn network as a giant web – you're a dot in the middle, and everyone you're connected to is another dot with lines linking you together.</br>\n",
    "        A GNN is like a super-smart detective who analyzes this web of connections. <br>\n",
    "        It looks at your profile (your skills, experience, etc.), who you're already connected to (your colleagues, classmates, etc.), and then uses this information to find other similar dots (people) in the web. These similar dots become your suggested connections – people you might know or who share similar backgrounds, making them potentially valuable connections for you.\n",
